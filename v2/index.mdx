Welcome to **V2** of Salsa as a Service. This version introduces improved API consistency, clearer response shapes, and advanced functionality intended for production-scale integrations.

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

## Using the AI assistant effectively

Mintlify supports a contextual “AI” menu (for example: copy, view, ChatGPT/Claude, etc.). It’s useful when you want to:
- Generate example requests in your preferred language
- Summarize a section for quick understanding
- Convert a curl example into Python/Node
- Draft a troubleshooting message for support

<Callout type="tip">
Highlight a section or use the page menu to send context into an AI tool — it helps you stay in flow while integrating.
</Callout>

## Versioning notes

If you still need the older API docs, see **V1 (Legacy)** in the sidebar. V2 is the recommended default for new integrations.
