# Navigation & Structure Decisions

## Decision-Making Process

During the restructuring of the documentation phase, the way I saw things was to create an easy and clear to understand structure. For this, I've tried to put myself in the customer's shoes and thought about me as a new user, about onboarding, about possible integrations, existing troubleshooting guides, etc. 

Then as v2 is the latest version, I considered it to become the default version, and label V1 as legacy, this way when someone looks at the page, the person can understand what's the most up-to date version, but also can find help if that person is still using the legacy version. 

As a French speaker myself, and working for many years with the French market, I know how important it is for them to see the same content in their language, so I've mirrored the structure across English and French versions.

## Key User Experience Improvements

The updated structure improves the easy and intuitive usage as follows: 

- V2 appears first, showing users the current version(most up-to date).
- V1 is labeled as legacy so it's easy to choose which versions you want/need to use depending on your system. 
- Language sections are grouped logically and mirror each other.
- Page order is consistent across versions.

These changes help users quickly find relevant information without needing to understand the internal version history.

## Trade-Offs Considered

I was thinking if I should minimize the sidebar length or keep the version boundaries pretty easy to see and clear. The easiest option for support consideration was to keep the version boundaries easy to see. 

Then my next thought was about using a language toggle, but knowing how the French market works and what expectations French people have in general, I prefered to keep the structure transparent.

## Scalability for Future Growth

The navigation is structured to support:

- Addition of V3 without changing the structure of the already existing content
- The possibility of introducing new languages (e.g., Spanish) using the same mirrored pattern
- Clear version lifecycle management (current vs legacy)

Because the JSON structure mirrors the folder structure, future updates can be implemented with minimal risk of breaking navigation.

Overall, the goal was to prioritize clarity, consistency, and long-term maintainability.
