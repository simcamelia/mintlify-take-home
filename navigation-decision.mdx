# Navigation & Structure Decisions

## Decision-Making Process

When restructuring the documentation, my primary goal was clarity. I started by identifying the main user journeys: new users onboarding, developers implementing integrations, and existing users troubleshooting or reviewing changes.

To reduce confusion, I made V2 the default and clearly labeled V1 as a legacy version. This ensures that most users are directed toward the most up-to-date documentation while still preserving access to older versions.

I also mirrored the structure across English and French versions to maintain consistency. This prevents navigation differences between languages and supports easier long-term maintenance.

## Key User Experience Improvements

The updated structure improves usability in several ways:

- V2 appears first, guiding users toward the current version.
- V1 is clearly labeled as legacy to prevent accidental use.
- Language sections are grouped logically and mirror each other.
- Page order is consistent across versions, reducing relearning effort.
- The sidebar avoids deep nesting to minimize cognitive load.

These changes help users quickly find relevant information without needing to understand internal version history.

## Trade-Offs Considered

One key trade-off was between minimizing sidebar length and keeping version boundaries explicit. Combining versions under shared feature categories would shorten the sidebar, but it could introduce ambiguity and increase support overhead.

I chose explicit separation for clarity and maintainability.

Another consideration was whether to use a language toggle approach instead of grouping languages in the sidebar. While a toggle can be elegant, grouping languages keeps structure transparent and easier to scale within the current setup.

## Scalability for Future Growth

The navigation is structured to support:

- Addition of V3 without restructuring existing content
- Introduction of new languages (e.g., Spanish) using the same mirrored pattern
- Clear version lifecycle management (current vs legacy)

Because the JSON structure mirrors the folder structure, future updates can be implemented with minimal risk of breaking navigation.

Overall, the goal was to prioritize clarity, consistency, and long-term maintainability.
