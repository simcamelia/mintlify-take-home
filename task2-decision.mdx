# Task 2 — Component Decisions

## Component Strategy

For v2, the goal was not just to “add components,” but to apply them intentionally based on how developers consume documentation: scanning first, then drilling into detail.

### VersionBanner (Custom React Component)

Implemented to ensure clear version awareness across pages.  
Because both v1 and v2 exist, visual version context reduces confusion and prevents accidental reference to legacy endpoints.

This also supports localized messaging in French pages.

---

### CardGroup

Used on the v2 landing page to create a visual entry hub.  
Compared to plain link lists, cards improve discoverability and make primary paths (Getting Started, API Reference, Advanced Usage) immediately obvious.

---

### Steps

Applied to onboarding and setup flows in *Getting Started*.  
Procedural content becomes structured and sequential, turning static instructions into an actionable setup journey.

---

### Tabs

Used for:
- Request vs Response examples  
- Multi-context API examples  

Tabs reduce vertical scrolling and allow side-by-side conceptual grouping without overwhelming the page.

---

### CodeGroup / CodeBlock

Used for multi-language and multi-environment examples (curl, Node, Python).

This reflects real developer workflows and keeps implementation examples organized without duplicating explanatory text.

---

### Callouts (info, tip, warning)

Used to:
- Highlight compatibility notes  
- Surface rate limits  
- Emphasize migration considerations  
- Provide contextual guidance  

Callouts isolate important information without interrupting narrative flow.

---

### Accordion

Used for dense reference material (e.g., error codes).  
This keeps the page scannable while preserving full detail for users who need it.

---

## UX Improvements

The refactor improves:

- Scannability and information hierarchy  
- Developer orientation (clear version context)  
- Reduced cognitive load  
- Multi-language example clarity  
- Structured onboarding flow  

The documentation moves from flat MDX text to a structured, product-grade developer experience.

---

## Custom Styling Rationale

The custom `VersionBanner` was intentionally lightweight:

- Minimal inline styling for maintainability  
- Clear visual distinction between current and legacy versions  
- Reusable across English and French pages  

The goal was consistency and clarity — not heavy customization — while demonstrating extensibility within Mintlify’s ecosystem.
