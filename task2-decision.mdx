# Task 2 — Component Decisions

## Why These Components Were Chosen

To improve clarity and usability of the v2 documentation, I selected Mintlify components based on the **type of content** and how developers typically consume docs:

- **VersionBanner (custom React component)**  
  Used at the top of each v2 page to clearly signal version context. This reduces confusion between v1 and v2 and improves orientation.

- **CardGroup**  
  Used on the v2 landing page to create a visual navigation hub. Cards make it easier to choose a path (Getting Started vs API Reference) compared to a long list of links.

- **Steps**  
  Used in Getting Started flows to structure setup instructions clearly. This turns procedural text into an actionable onboarding journey.

- **Tabs**  
  Used for Request vs Response and multi-context examples. Tabs reduce scrolling and allow users to switch views without losing context.

- **CodeGroup / CodeBlock**  
  Used for multi-language and multi-environment examples (curl, Node, Python). This mirrors real developer workflows and keeps examples organized.

- **Callouts (info, tip, warning)**  
  Used to highlight prerequisites, rate limits, compatibility notes, and best practices without interrupting the main content flow.

- **Accordion**  
  Used for error catalogs to keep dense reference material collapsible and readable.

## How These Enhancements Improve UX

- Improve **scannability** and reduce cognitive load  
- Separate instructional content from reference content  
- Support real developer workflows (multi-language examples)  
- Reduce vertical scrolling through structured components  
- Clearly signal important information (warnings, tips, compatibility)

Overall, the documentation shifts from basic MDX text to a more structured, product-grade experience.

## Custom Styling Decisions

The `VersionBanner` component was implemented as a lightweight custom React component to:

- Provide consistent version awareness across pages  
- Visually distinguish current vs legacy versions  
- Allow localized messaging in French pages  

Inline styling was intentionally kept minimal to ensure maintainability while still providing clear visual hierarchy.
